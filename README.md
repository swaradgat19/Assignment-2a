# Assignment-2a

In this project, I have visualized the **Breast Cancer Dataset**. 

I have performed PCA (Principal Component Analysis). After PCA, a scree plot is produced. The user can click on the red dots on the scree plot to select the dimentionality index and accordingly, the table beneath changes. 

For example, if a user clicks on k = 3, the top 4 attributes are displayed for k = 1 to k = 3. The loadings of k = 1 to k = 3 are displayed in the table, along with the sum of squared loadings
